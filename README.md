## Introduction
### Definition

## Methods
### MatrixEQTL for the QTL mapping

## Results

## Confirm the reality
### The biological stuff under the GW significant QTL rs7817589.
#### Check the **covariates** in 200HIV cohort
No significant(alpha = 0.05) results

#### Check the **cytokine** in 200HIV cohort
##### `B_cytokine`

##### `L_antiInflamCytokine`

#### Check the **cell counts (i.e. immunophenotyping)** in 200HIV cohort
##### T cells
##### Other cells

### Check rs7817589 in 500FG `WIP`
